#### Help / User Guide

This guide serve to let users get started with this shiny application. The application reference the same dataset used in the "Reproducible Research" course. Full description of this study report can be found in [RPubs](http://www.rpubs.com/EricLimBG/repdata-007).

* The application has been deployed on Rstudio's shiny server
* The application link can be found [here](http://www.rpubs.com/EricLimBG/repdata-007)
* The server.R and ui.R code can be found on [Github](http://www.rpubs.com/EricLimBG/repdata-007)
* The application also include the following:
    1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
    2. Some operation on the ui input in server.R
